O divine average!\r\n  Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or setting,\r\n  Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,\r\n  I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and\r\n      cheerfully pass them forward.\r\n       11\r\n  As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,\r\n  I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in\r\n      the briers hatching her brood.\r\n  I have seen the he-bird also,\r\n  I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and\r\n      joyfully singing.\r\n  And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for was\r\n      not there only,\r\n  Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,\r\n  But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,\r\n  A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.\r\n       12\r\n  Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and\r\n      joyfully singing.\r\n  Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,\r\n  For those who belong here and those to come,\r\n  I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger\r\n      and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.\r\n  I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,\r\n  And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes,\r\n      and carry you with me the same as any.\r\n  I will make the true poem of riches,\r\n  To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward\r\n      and is not dropt by death;\r\n  I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the\r\n      bard of personality,\r\n  And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of\r\n      the other,\r\n  And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am determin'd\r\n      to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you illustrious,\r\n  And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and\r\n      can be none in the future,\r\n  And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn'd to\r\n      beautiful results,\r\n  And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death,\r\n  And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are\r\n      compact,\r\n  And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each\r\n      as profound as any.\r\n  I will not make poems with reference to parts,\r\n  But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,\r\n  And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to\r\n      all days,\r\n  And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has\r\n      reference to the soul,\r\n  Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find there\r\n      is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul.\r\n       13\r\n  Was somebody asking to see the soul?\r\n  See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts,\r\n      the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.\r\n  All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;\r\n  How can the real body ever die and be buried?\r\n  Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,\r\n  Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and\r\n      pass to fitting spheres,\r\n  Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the\r\n      moment of death.\r\n  Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the\r\n      meaning, the main concern,\r\n  Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's substance and\r\n      life return in the body and the soul,\r\n  Indifferently before death and after death.\r\n  Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and\r\n      includes and is the soul;\r\n  Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part\r\n      of it!\r\n       14\r\n  Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!\r\n  Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?\r\n  Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?\r\n  Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,\r\n  Exulting words, words to Democracy's lands.\r\n  Interlink'd, food-yielding lands!\r\n  Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar, rice!\r\n  Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the apple\r\n      and the grape!\r\n  Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! land of\r\n      those sweet-air'd interminable plateaus!\r\n  Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!\r\n  Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where the south-west\r\n      Colorado winds!\r\n  Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!\r\n  Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!\r\n  Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and\r\n      Connecticut!\r\n  Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!\r\n  Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land!\r\n  Inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate ones!\r\n  The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony-limb'd!\r\n  The great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and\r\n      the inexperienced sisters!\r\n  Far breath'd land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez'd! the diverse! the\r\n      compact!\r\n  The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!\r\n  O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at any\r\n      rate include you all with perfect love!\r\n  I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner than another!\r\n  O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with\r\n      irrepressible love,\r\n  Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,\r\n  Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on\r\n      Paumanok's sands,\r\n  Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in every town,\r\n  Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,\r\n  Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,\r\n  Of and through the States as during life, each man and woman my neighbor,\r\n  The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him and her,\r\n  The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with any of them,\r\n  Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house of adobie,\r\n  Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland,\r\n  Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice welcome to me,\r\n  Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the\r\n      Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,\r\n  Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every\r\n      new brother,\r\n  Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they\r\n      unite with the old ones,\r\n  Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal,\r\n      coming personally to you now,\r\n  Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.\r\n       15\r\n  With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on.\r\n  For your life adhere to me,\r\n  (I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give\r\n      myself really to you, but what of that?\r\n  Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)\r\n  No dainty dolce affettuoso I,\r\n  Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck'd, forbidding, I have arrived,\r\n  To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,\r\n  For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.\r\n       16\r\n  On my way a moment I pause,\r\n  Here for you! and here for America!\r\n  Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I\r\n      harbinge glad and sublime,\r\n  And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines.\r\n  The red aborigines,\r\n  Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds\r\n      and animals in the woods, syllabled to us for names,\r\n  Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee,\r\n      Kaqueta, Oronoco,\r\n  Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla,\r\n  Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging the\r\n      water and the land with names.\r\n       17\r\n  Expanding and swift, henceforth,\r\n  Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and audacious,\r\n  A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and branching,\r\n  A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with new contests,\r\n  New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts.\r\n  These, my voice announcing--I will sleep no more but arise,\r\n  You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you,\r\n      fathomless, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms.\r\n       18\r\n  See, steamers steaming through my poems,\r\n  See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing,\r\n  See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flat-boat,\r\n      the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village,\r\n  See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern Sea,\r\n      how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their own shores,\r\n  See, pastures and forests in my poems--see, animals wild and tame--see,\r\n      beyond the Kaw, countless herds of buffalo feeding on short curly grass,\r\n  See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets,\r\n      with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,\r\n  See, the many-cylinder'd steam printing-press--see, the electric\r\n      telegraph stretching across the continent,\r\n  See, through Atlantica's depths pulses American Europe reaching,\r\n      pulses of Europe duly return'd,\r\n  See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing\r\n      the steam-whistle,\r\n  See, ploughmen ploughing farms--see, miners digging mines--see,\r\n      the numberless factories,\r\n  See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools--see from among them\r\n      superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest in\r\n      working dresses,\r\n  See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me\r\n      well-belov'd, close-held by day and night,\r\n  Hear the loud echoes of my songs there--read the hints come at last.\r\n       19\r\n  O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.\r\n  O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!\r\n  O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!\r\n  O now I triumph--and you shall also;\r\n  O hand in hand--O wholesome pleasure--O one more desirer and lover!\r\n  O to haste firm holding--to haste, haste on with me.\r\n", "title": "Starting from Paumanok"}
{"text": "       1\r\n  I celebrate myself, and sing myself,\r\n  And what I assume you shall assume,\r\n  For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\r\n  I loafe and invite my soul,\r\n  I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.\r\n  My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,\r\n  Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their\r\n      parents the same,\r\n  I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,\r\n  Hoping to cease not till death.\r\n  Creeds and schools in abeyance,\r\n  Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,\r\n  I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,\r\n  Nature without check with original energy.\r\n       2\r\n  Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with\r\n      perfumes,\r\n  I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,\r\n  The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\r\n  The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the\r\n      distillation, it is odorless,\r\n  It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,\r\n  I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,\r\n  I am mad for it to be in contact with me.\r\n  The smoke of my own breath,\r\n  Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,\r\n  My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing\r\n      of blood and air through my lungs,\r\n  The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and\r\n      dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,\r\n  The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of\r\n      the wind,\r\n  A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\r\n  The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,\r\n  The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields\r\n      and hill-sides,\r\n  The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising\r\n      from bed and meeting the sun.\r\n  Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?\r\n  Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?\r\n  Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\r\n  Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of\r\n      all poems,\r\n  You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions\r\n      of suns left,)\r\n  You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through\r\n      the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\r\n  You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\r\n  You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\r\n       3\r\n  I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\r\n      beginning and the end,\r\n  But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\r\n  There was never any more inception than there is now,\r\n  Nor any more youth or age than there is now,\r\n  And will never be any more perfection than there is now,\r\n  Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\r\n  Urge and urge and urge,\r\n  Always the procreant urge of the world.\r\n  Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and\r\n      increase, always sex,\r\n  Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\r\n  To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.\r\n  Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\r\n      entretied, braced in the beams,\r\n  Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\r\n  I and this mystery here we stand.\r\n  Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.\r\n  Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\r\n  Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\r\n  Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\r\n  Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they\r\n      discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\r\n  Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,\r\n  Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be\r\n      less familiar than the rest.\r\n  I am satisfied--I see, dance, laugh, sing;\r\n  As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night,\r\n      and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,\r\n  Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house with\r\n      their plenty,\r\n  Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\r\n  That they turn from gazing after and down the road,\r\n  And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\r\n  Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?\r\n       4\r\n  Trippers and askers surround me,\r\n  People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and\r\n      city I live in, or the nation,\r\n  The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\r\n  My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\r\n  The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\r\n  The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss\r\n      or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\r\n  Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news,\r\n      the fitful events;\r\n  These come to me days and nights and go from me again,\r\n  But they are not the Me myself.\r\n  Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\r\n  Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\r\n  Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\r\n  Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\r\n  Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\r\n  Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with\r\n      linguists and contenders,\r\n  I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\r\n       5\r\n  I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\r\n  And you must not be abased to the other.\r\n  Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\r\n  Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not\r\n      even the best,\r\n  Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\r\n  I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\r\n  How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,\r\n  And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue\r\n      to my bare-stript heart,\r\n  And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.\r\n  Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass\r\n      all the argument of the earth,\r\n  And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\r\n  And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\r\n  And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women\r\n      my sisters and lovers,\r\n  And that a kelson of the creation is love,\r\n  And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\r\n  And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\r\n  And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and\r\n      poke-weed.\r\n       6\r\n  A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\r\n  How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.\r\n  I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green\r\n      stuff woven.\r\n  Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\r\n  A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\r\n  Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see\r\n      and remark, and say Whose?\r\n  Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\r\n  Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\r\n  And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\r\n  Growing among black folks as among white,\r\n  Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I\r\n      receive them the same.\r\n  And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\r\n  Tenderly will I use you curling grass,\r\n  It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\r\n  It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\r\n  It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out\r\n      of their mothers' laps,\r\n  And here you are the mothers' laps.\r\n  This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,\r\n  Darker than the colorless beards of old men,\r\n  Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\r\n  O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\r\n  And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\r\n  I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\r\n  And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken\r\n      soon out of their laps.\r\n  What do you think has become of the young and old men?\r\n  And what do you think has become of the women and children?\r\n  They are alive and well somewhere,\r\n  The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\r\n  And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the\r\n      end to arrest it,\r\n  And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.\r\n  All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\r\n  And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\r\n       7\r\n  Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?\r\n  I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\r\n  I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd babe, and\r\n      am not contain'd between my hat and boots,\r\n  And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,\r\n  The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\r\n  I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\r\n  I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and\r\n      fathomless as myself,\r\n  (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\r\n  Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,\r\n  For me those that have been boys and that love women,\r\n  For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,\r\n  For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the\r\n      mothers of mothers,\r\n  For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\r\n  For me children and the begetters of children.\r\n  Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\r\n  I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\r\n  And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\r\n       8\r\n  The little one sleeps in its cradle,\r\n  I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies\r\n      with my hand.\r\n  The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,\r\n  I peeringly view them from the top.\r\n  The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\r\n  I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol\r\n      has fallen.\r\n  The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\r\n      the promenaders,\r\n  The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the\r\n      clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\r\n  The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\r\n  The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,\r\n  The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\r\n  The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\r\n  The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his\r\n      passage to the centre of the crowd,\r\n  The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\r\n  What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or in fits,\r\n  What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and\r\n      give birth to babes,\r\n  What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls\r\n      restrain'd by decorum,\r\n  Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances,\r\n      rejections with convex lips,\r\n  I mind them or the show or resonance of them--I come and I depart.\r\n       9\r\n  The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\r\n  The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,\r\n  The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\r\n  The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\r\n  I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\r\n  I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\r\n  I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,\r\n  And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\r\n       10\r\n  Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\r\n  Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\r\n  In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\r\n  Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,\r\n  Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\r\n  The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,\r\n  My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.\r\n  The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\r\n  I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\r\n  You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\r\n  I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west,\r\n      the bride was a red girl,\r\n  Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking,\r\n      they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets\r\n      hanging from their shoulders,\r\n  On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant\r\n      beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\r\n  She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks\r\n      descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.\r\n  The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\r\n  I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\r\n  Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\r\n  And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\r\n  And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and bruis'd feet,\r\n  And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some\r\n      coarse clean clothes,\r\n  And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\r\n  And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\r\n  He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,\r\n  I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.\r\n       11\r\n  Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\r\n  Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\r\n  Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\r\n  She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\r\n  She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.\r\n  Which of the young men does she like the best?\r\n  Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\r\n  Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,\r\n  You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\r\n  Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\r\n  The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\r\n  The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from their long hair,\r\n  Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.\r\n  An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,\r\n  It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\r\n  The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the\r\n      sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\r\n  They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\r\n  They do not think whom they souse with spray.\r\n       12\r\n  The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife\r\n      at the stall in the market,\r\n  I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\r\n  Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\r\n  Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in\r\n      the fire.\r\n  From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,\r\n  The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\r\n  Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\r\n  They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\r\n       13\r\n  The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags\r\n      underneath on its tied-over chain,\r\n  The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and\r\n      tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,\r\n  His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over\r\n      his hip-band,\r\n  His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat\r\n      away from his forehead,\r\n  The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of\r\n      his polish'd and perfect limbs.\r\n  I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\r\n  I go with the team also.\r\n  In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as\r\n      forward sluing,\r\n  To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\r\n  Absorbing all to myself and for this song.\r\n  Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what\r\n      is that you express in your eyes?\r\n  It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\r\n  My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and\r\n      day-long ramble,\r\n  They rise together, they slowly circle around.\r\n  I believe in those wing'd purposes,\r\n  And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\r\n  And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\r\n  And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\r\n  And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\r\n  And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\r\n       14\r\n  The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\r\n  Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\r\n  The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\r\n  Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\r\n  The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\r\n      chickadee, the prairie-dog,\r\n  The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\r\n  The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\r\n  I see in them and myself the same old law.\r\n  The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\r\n  They scorn the best I can do to relate them.\r\n  I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,\r\n  Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\r\n  Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and\r\n      mauls, and the drivers of horses,\r\n  I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\r\n  What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\r\n  Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\r\n  Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\r\n  Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,\r\n  Scattering it freely forever.\r\n       15\r\n  The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\r\n  The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\r\n      whistles its wild ascending lisp,\r\n  The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,\r\n  The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,\r\n  The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,\r\n  The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\r\n  The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,\r\n  The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,\r\n  The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and\r\n      looks at the oats and rye,\r\n  The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,\r\n  (He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother's\r\n      bed-room;)\r\n  The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,\r\n  He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;\r\n  The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,\r\n  What is removed drops horribly in a pail;\r\n  The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by\r\n      the bar-room stove,\r\n  The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat,\r\n      the gate-keeper marks who pass,\r\n  The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do\r\n      not know him;)\r\n  The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\r\n  The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their\r\n      rifles, some sit on logs,\r\n  Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;\r\n  The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\r\n  As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them\r\n      from his saddle,\r\n  The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\r\n      partners, the dancers bow to each other,\r\n  The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to the\r\n      musical rain,\r\n  The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\r\n  The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering moccasins and\r\n      bead-bags for sale,\r\n  The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut\r\n      eyes bent sideways,\r\n  As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for\r\n      the shore-going passengers,\r\n  The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it\r\n      off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,\r\n  The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne\r\n      her first child,\r\n  The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the\r\n      factory or mill,\r\n  The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter's lead\r\n      flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering\r\n      with blue and gold,\r\n  The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his\r\n      desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\r\n  The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,\r\n  The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\r\n  The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white\r\n      sails sparkle!)\r\n  The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\r\n  The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling\r\n      about the odd cent;)\r\n  The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock\r\n      moves slowly,\r\n  The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,\r\n  The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and\r\n      pimpled neck,\r\n  The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to\r\n      each other,\r\n  (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\r\n  The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great\r\n      Secretaries,\r\n  On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,\r\n  The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,\r\n  The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,\r\n  As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the\r\n      jingling of loose change,\r\n  The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\r\n      roof, the masons are calling for mortar,\r\n  In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;\r\n  Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather'd, it\r\n      is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)\r\n  Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows,\r\n      and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\r\n  Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in\r\n      the frozen surface,\r\n  The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep\r\n      with his axe,\r\n  Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,\r\n  Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\r\n      those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\r\n  Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,\r\n  Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons\r\n      around them,\r\n  In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after\r\n      their day's sport,\r\n  The city sleeps and the country sleeps,\r\n  The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\r\n  The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;\r\n  And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\r\n  And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\r\n  And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\r\n       16\r\n  I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\r\n  Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,\r\n  Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\r\n  Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff\r\n      that is fine,\r\n  One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the\r\n      largest the same,\r\n  A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and\r\n      hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\r\n  A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest\r\n      joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\r\n  A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\r\n      leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\r\n  A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;\r\n  At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen\r\n      off Newfoundland,\r\n  At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,\r\n  At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the\r\n      Texan ranch,\r\n  Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving\r\n      their big proportions,)\r\n  Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands\r\n      and welcome to drink and meat,\r\n  A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\r\n  A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\r\n  Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\r\n  A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\r\n  Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\r\n  I resist any thing better than my own diversity,\r\n  Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,\r\n  And am not stuck up, and am in my place.\r\n  (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\r\n  The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,\r\n  The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\r\n       17\r\n  These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they\r\n      are not original with me,\r\n  If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,\r\n  If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,\r\n  If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.\r\n  This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,\r\n  This the common air that bathes the globe.\r\n       18\r\n  With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\r\n  I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for\r\n      conquer'd and slain persons.\r\n  Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?\r\n  I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit\r\n      in which they are won.\r\n  I beat and pound for the dead,\r\n  I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\r\n  Vivas to those who have fail'd!\r\n  And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\r\n  And to those themselves who sank in the sea!\r\n  And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!\r\n  And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!\r\n       19\r\n  This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\r\n  It is for the wicked just same as the righteous, I make appointments\r\n      with all,\r\n  I will not have a single person slighted or left away,\r\n  The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\r\n  The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\r\n  There shall be no difference between them and the rest.\r\n  This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,\r\n  This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\r\n  This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\r\n  This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\r\n  Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?\r\n  Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the\r\n      side of a rock has.\r\n  Do you take it I would astonish?\r\n  Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\r\n      through the woods?\r\n  Do I astonish more than they?\r\n  This hour I tell things in confidence,\r\n  I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\r\n       20\r\n  Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\r\n  How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\r\n  What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\r\n  All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\r\n  Else it were time lost listening to me.\r\n  I do not snivel that snivel the world over,\r\n  That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\r\n  Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity\r\n      goes to the fourth-remov'd,\r\n  I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\r\n  Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\r\n  Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with\r\n      doctors and calculated close,\r\n  I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\r\n  In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\r\n  And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\r\n  I know I am solid and sound,\r\n  To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\r\n  All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\r\n  I know I am deathless,\r\n  I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,\r\n  I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt\r\n      stick at night.\r\n  I know I am august,\r\n  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\r\n  I see that the elementary laws never apologize,\r\n  (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by,\r\n      after all.)\r\n  I exist as I am, that is enough,\r\n  If no other in the world be aware I sit content,\r\n  And if each and all be aware I sit content.\r\n  One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,\r\n  And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten\r\n      million years,\r\n  I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\r\n  My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,\r\n  I laugh at what you call dissolution,\r\n  And I know the amplitude of time.\r\n       21\r\n  I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\r\n  The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,\r\n  The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate\r\n      into new tongue.\r\n  I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\r\n  And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\r\n  And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\r\n  I chant the chant of dilation or pride,\r\n  We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\r\n  I show that size is only development.\r\n  Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?\r\n  It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\r\n      still pass on.\r\n  I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\r\n  I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\r\n  Press close bare-bosom'd night--press close magnetic nourishing night!\r\n  Night of south winds--night of the large few stars!\r\n  Still nodding night--mad naked summer night.\r\n  Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!\r\n  Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\r\n  Earth of departed sunset--earth of the mountains misty-topt!\r\n  Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\r\n  Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\r\n  Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\r\n  Far-swooping elbow'd earth--rich apple-blossom'd earth!\r\n  Smile, for your lover comes.\r\n  Prodigal, you have given me love--therefore I to you give love!\r\n  O unspeakable passionate love.\r\n       22\r\n  You sea! I resign myself to you also--I guess what you mean,\r\n  I behold from the beach your crooked fingers,\r\n  I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\r\n  We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,\r\n  Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\r\n  Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\r\n  Sea of stretch'd ground-swells,\r\n  Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\r\n  Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready graves,\r\n  Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\r\n  I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\r\n  Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\r\n  Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.\r\n  I am he attesting sympathy,\r\n  (Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that\r\n      supports them?)\r\n  I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet\r\n      of wickedness also.\r\n  What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\r\n  Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,\r\n  My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,\r\n  I moisten the roots of all that has grown.\r\n  Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\r\n  Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and rectified?\r\n  I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance,\r\n  Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\r\n  Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\r\n  This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\r\n  There is no better than it and now.\r\n  What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such wonder,\r\n  The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\r\n       23\r\n  Endless unfolding of words of ages!\r\n  And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\r\n  A word of the faith that never balks,\r\n  Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.\r\n  It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\r\n  That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\r\n  I accept Reality and dare not question it,\r\n  Materialism first and last imbuing.\r\n  Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\r\n  Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\r\n  This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of\r\n      the old cartouches,\r\n  These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.\r\n  This is the geologist, this works with the scalper, and this is a\r\n      mathematician.\r\n  Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!\r\n  Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\r\n  I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\r\n  Less the reminders of properties told my words,\r\n  And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\r\n  And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and\r\n      women fully equipt,\r\n  And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that\r\n      plot and conspire.\r\n       24\r\n  Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\r\n  Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,\r\n  No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\r\n  No more modest than immodest.\r\n  Unscrew the locks from the doors!\r\n  Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\r\n  Whoever degrades another degrades me,\r\n  And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\r\n  Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current\r\n      and index.\r\n  I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\r\n  By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their\r\n      counterpart of on the same terms.\r\n  Through me many long dumb voices,\r\n  Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,\r\n  Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\r\n  Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\r\n  And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the\r\n      father-stuff,\r\n  And of the rights of them the others are down upon,\r\n  Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\r\n  Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\r\n  Through me forbidden voices,\r\n  Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,\r\n  Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.\r\n  I do not press my fingers across my mouth,\r\n  I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\r\n  Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.\r\n  I believe in the flesh and the appetites,\r\n  Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me\r\n      is a miracle.\r\n  Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am\r\n      touch'd from,\r\n  The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\r\n  This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\r\n  If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of\r\n      my own body, or any part of it,\r\n  Translucent mould of me it shall be you!\r\n  Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\r\n  Firm masculine colter it shall be you!\r\n  Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\r\n  You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\r\n  Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\r\n  My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\r\n  Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded\r\n      duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\r\n  Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\r\n  Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\r\n  Sun so generous it shall be you!\r\n  Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\r\n  You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\r\n  Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\r\n  Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my\r\n      winding paths, it shall be you!\r\n  Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd,\r\n      it shall be you.\r\n  I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\r\n  Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\r\n  I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,\r\n  Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\r\n      friendship I take again.\r\n  That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\r\n  A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics\r\n      of books.\r\n  To behold the day-break!\r\n  The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\r\n  The air tastes good to my palate.\r\n  Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising\r\n      freshly exuding,\r\n  Scooting obliquely high and low.\r\n  Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\r\n  Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\r\n  The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\r\n  The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\r\n  The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\r\n       25\r\n  Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\r\n  If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\r\n  We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\r\n  We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\r\n  My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\r\n  With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\r\n  Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\r\n  It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\r\n  Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?\r\n  Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\r\n      articulation,\r\n  Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\r\n  Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,\r\n  The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\r\n  I underlying causes to balance them at last,\r\n  My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\r\n  Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\r\n      of this day.)\r\n  My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\r\n  Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\r\n  I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\r\n  Writing and talk do not prove me,\r\n  I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\r\n  With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\r\n       26\r\n  Now I will do nothing but listen,\r\n  To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\r\n  I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,\r\n      clack of sticks cooking my meals,\r\n  I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\r\n  I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\r\n  Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\r\n  Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of\r\n      work-people at their meals,\r\n  The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\r\n  The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing\r\n      a death-sentence,\r\n  The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the\r\n      refrain of the anchor-lifters,\r\n  The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking\r\n      engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color'd lights,\r\n  The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\r\n  The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching two and two,\r\n  (They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\r\n  I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)\r\n  I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\r\n  It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\r\n  I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\r\n  Ah this indeed is music--this suits me.\r\n  A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\r\n  The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\r\n  I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\r\n  The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\r\n  It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd them,\r\n  It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent waves,\r\n  I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\r\n  Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\r\n  At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\r\n  And that we call Being.\r\n       27\r\n  To be in any form, what is that?\r\n  (Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\r\n  If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\r\n  Mine is no callous shell,\r\n  I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\r\n  They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\r\n  I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\r\n  To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.\r\n       28\r\n  Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\r\n  Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,\r\n  Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\r\n  My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\r\n      different from myself,\r\n  On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\r\n  Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\r\n  Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\r\n  Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,\r\n  Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\r\n  Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\r\n  Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\r\n  They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\r\n  No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\r\n  Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\r\n  Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\r\n  The sentries desert every other part of me,\r\n  They have left me helpless to a red marauder,\r\n  They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\r\n  I am given up by traitors,\r\n  I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\r\n      greatest traitor,\r\n  I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\r\n  You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\r\n  Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\r\n       29\r\n  Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd touch!\r\n  Did it make you ache so, leaving me?\r\n  Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\r\n  Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\r\n  Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\r\n  Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\r\n       30\r\n  All truths wait in all things,\r\n  They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\r\n  They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\r\n  The insignificant is as big to me as any,\r\n  (What is less or more than a touch?)\r\n  Logic and sermons never convince,\r\n  The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\r\n  (Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\r\n  Only what nobody denies is so.)\r\n  A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\r\n  I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\r\n  And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\r\n  And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\r\n  And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\r\n      becomes omnific,\r\n  And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\r\n       31\r\n  I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,\r\n  And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\r\n      of the wren,\r\n  And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\r\n  And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\r\n  And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\r\n  And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,\r\n  And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\r\n  I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\r\n      grains, esculent roots,\r\n  And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\r\n  And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\r\n  But call any thing back again when I desire it.\r\n  In vain the speeding or shyness,\r\n  In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\r\n  In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,\r\n  In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\r\n  In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\r\n  In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\r\n  In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\r\n  In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\r\n  In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,\r\n  I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\r\n       32\r\n  I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\r\n      self-contain'd,\r\n  I stand and look at them long and long.\r\n  They do not sweat and whine about their condition,\r\n  They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\r\n  They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\r\n  Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\r\n      owning things,\r\n  Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\r\n      years ago,\r\n  Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\r\n  So they show their relations to me and I accept them,\r\n  They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their\r\n      possession.\r\n  I wonder where they get those tokens,\r\n  Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\r\n  Myself moving forward then and now and forever,\r\n  Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,\r\n  Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\r\n  Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\r\n  Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\r\n  A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\r\n  Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\r\n  Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\r\n  Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\r\n  His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\r\n  His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\r\n  I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\r\n  Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\r\n  Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\r\n       33\r\n  Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,\r\n  What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,\r\n  What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,\r\n  And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\r\n  My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\r\n  I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\r\n  I am afoot with my vision.\r\n  By the city's quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumber-men,\r\n  Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\r\n  Weeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,\r\n      crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\r\n  Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\r\n  Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\r\n      shallow river,\r\n  Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\r\n      buck turns furiously at the hunter,\r\n  Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\r\n      otter is feeding on fish,\r\n  Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\r\n  Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\r\n      beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\r\n  Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton plant, over\r\n      the rice in its low moist field,\r\n  Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum and\r\n      slender shoots from the gutters,\r\n  Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over the\r\n      delicate blue-flower flax,\r\n  Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\r\n      the rest,\r\n  Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\r\n  Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\r\n      scragged limbs,\r\n  Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\r\n  Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\r\n  Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\r\n      goldbug drops through the dark,\r\n  Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\r\n      the meadow,\r\n  Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\r\n      shuddering of their hides,\r\n  Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle\r\n      the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\r\n  Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\r\n  Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\r\n  Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\r\n      myself and looking composedly down,)\r\n  Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\r\n      hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\r\n  Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\r\n  Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\r\n  Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\r\n  Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,\r\n  Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\r\n  Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\r\n  Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\r\n  Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\r\n  Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\r\n  Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\r\n      base-ball,\r\n  At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\r\n      bull-dances, drinking, laughter,\r\n  At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the\r\n      juice through a straw,\r\n  At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\r\n  At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;\r\n  Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\r\n      screams, weeps,\r\n  Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are\r\n      scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\r\n  Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to\r\n      the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\r\n  Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\r\n  Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\r\n  Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\r\n      far and near,\r\n  Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\r\n      swan is curving and winding,\r\n  Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\r\n      near-human laugh,\r\n  Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\r\n      high weeds,\r\n  Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\r\n      their heads out,\r\n  Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,\r\n  Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\r\n  Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\r\n      night and feeds upon small crabs,\r\n  Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\r\n  Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\r\n      the well,\r\n  Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\r\n  Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\r\n  Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the\r\n      office or public hall;\r\n  Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with\r\n      the new and old,\r\n  Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\r\n  Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\r\n  Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,\r\n  Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,\r\n      impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;\r\n  Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\r\n      flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\r\n  Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds,\r\n      or down a lane or along the beach,\r\n  My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\r\n  Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me\r\n      he rides at the drape of the day,)\r\n  Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the\r\n      moccasin print,\r\n  By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\r\n  Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\r\n  Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\r\n  Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\r\n  Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\r\n  Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\r\n  Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\r\n  Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\r\n  Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\r\n      diameter of eighty thousand miles,\r\n  Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\r\n  Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\r\n  Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\r\n  Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,\r\n  I tread day and night such roads.\r\n  I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\r\n  And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.\r\n  I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\r\n  My course runs below the soundings of plummets.\r\n  I help myself to material and immaterial,\r\n  No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\r\n  I anchor my ship for a little while only,\r\n  My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\r\n  I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\r\n      pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\r\n  I ascend to the foretruck,\r\n  I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,\r\n  We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\r\n  Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\r\n  The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\r\n      plain in all directions,\r\n  The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\r\n      fancies toward them,\r\n  We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\r\n      be engaged,\r\n  We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\r\n      feet and caution,\r\n  Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,\r\n  The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\r\n      of the globe.\r\n  I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\r\n  I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\r\n  I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\r\n  My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\r\n  They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.\r\n  I understand the large hearts of heroes,\r\n  The courage of present times and all times,\r\n  How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\r\n      steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\r\n  How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\r\n      days and faithful of nights,\r\n  And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\r\n      not desert you;\r\n  How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days and\r\n      would not give it up,\r\n  How he saved the drifting company at last,\r\n  How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated from the\r\n      side of their prepared graves,\r\n  How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\r\n      sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;\r\n  All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\r\n  I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.\r\n  The disdain and calmness of martyrs,\r\n  The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\r\n      children gazing on,\r\n  The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\r\n      blowing, cover'd with sweat,\r\n  The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\r\n      buckshot and the bullets,\r\n  All these I feel or am.\r\n  I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\r\n  Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\r\n  I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the\r\n      ooze of my skin,\r\n  I fall on the weeds and stones,\r\n  The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\r\n  Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\r\n  Agonies are one of my changes of garments,\r\n  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\r\n      wounded person,\r\n  My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\r\n  I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,\r\n  Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,\r\n  Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\r\n  I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\r\n  They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\r\n  I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\r\n  Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\r\n  White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\r\n      of their fire-caps,\r\n  The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\r\n  Distant and dead resuscitate,\r\n  They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\r\n  I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,\r\n  I am there again.\r\n  Again the long roll of the drummers,\r\n  Again the attacking cannon, mortars,\r\n  Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\r\n  I take part, I see and hear the whole,\r\n  The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\r\n  The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\r\n  Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\r\n  The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\r\n  The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\r\n  Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\r\n      with his hand,\r\n  He gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\r\n       34\r\n  Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\r\n  (I tell not the fall of Alamo,\r\n  Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\r\n  The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\r\n  'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\r\n      young men.\r\n  Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their baggage for\r\n      breastworks,\r\n  Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\r\n      number, was the price they took in advance,\r\n  Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\r\n  They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing and\r\n      seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners of war.\r\n  They were the glory of the race of rangers,\r\n  Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\r\n  Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\r\n  Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\r\n  Not a single one over thirty years of age.\r\n  The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\r\n      massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\r\n  The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by eight.\r\n  None obey'd the command to kneel,\r\n  Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\r\n  A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\r\n      lay together,\r\n  The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\r\n  Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,\r\n  These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the blunts of muskets,\r\n  A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two more\r\n      came to release him,\r\n  The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.\r\n  At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;\r\n  That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\r\n       35\r\n  Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\r\n  Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\r\n  List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me.\r\n  Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\r\n  His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\r\n      and never was, and never will be;\r\n  Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.\r\n  We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,\r\n  My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.\r\n  We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,\r\n  On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\r\n      killing all around and blowing up overhead.\r\n  Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\r\n  Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\r\n      and five feet of water reported,\r\n  The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\r\n      to give them a chance for themselves.\r\n  The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\r\n  They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\r\n  Our frigate takes fire,\r\n  The other asks if we demand quarter?\r\n  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?\r\n  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\r\n  We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\r\n      of the fighting.\r\n  Only three guns are in use,\r\n  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's main-mast,\r\n  Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and\r\n      clear his decks.\r\n  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\r\n      the main-top,\r\n  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\r\n  Not a moment's cease,\r\n  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\r\n  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\r\n  Serene stands the little captain,\r\n  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\r\n  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\r\n  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\r\n       36\r\n  Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,\r\n  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\r\n  Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\r\n      one we have conquer'd,\r\n  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\r\n      countenance white as a sheet,\r\n  Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,\r\n  The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\r\n      curl'd whiskers,\r\n  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\r\n  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\r\n  Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\r\n      upon the masts and spars,\r\n  Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\r\n  Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\r\n  A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\r\n  Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\r\n      the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\r\n  The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\r\n  Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\r\n      dull, tapering groan,\r\n  These so, these irretrievable.\r\n       37\r\n  You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\r\n  In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!\r\n  Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,\r\n  See myself in prison shaped like another man,\r\n  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.\r\n  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\r\n  It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.\r\n  Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him\r\n      and walk by his side,\r\n  (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\r\n      on my twitching lips.)\r\n  Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\r\n      and sentenced.\r\n  Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\r\n  My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\r\n  Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\r\n  I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\r\n       38\r\n  Enough! enough! enough!\r\n  Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!\r\n  Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\r\n  I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\r\n  That I could forget the mockers and insults!\r\n  That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\r\n      bludgeons and hammers!\r\n  That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\r\n      bloody crowning.\r\n  I remember now,\r\n  I resume the overstaid fraction,\r\n  The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\r\n  Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\r\n  I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average\r\n      unending procession,\r\n  Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\r\n  Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\r\n  The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\r\n  Eleves, I salute you! come forward!\r\n  Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.\r\n       39\r\n  The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\r\n  Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\r\n  Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?\r\n  Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\r\n  The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\r\n  Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\r\n  They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.\r\n  Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb'd\r\n      head, laughter, and naivete,\r\n  Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,\r\n  They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\r\n  They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of\r\n      the glance of his eyes.\r\n       40\r\n  Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask--lie over!\r\n  You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\r\n  Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\r\n  Say, old top-knot, what do you want?\r\n  Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\r\n  And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\r\n  And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.\r\n  Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\r\n  When I give I give myself.\r\n  You there, impotent, loose in the knees,\r\n  Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,\r\n  Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,\r\n  I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,\r\n  And any thing I have I bestow.\r\n  I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\r\n  You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.\r\n  To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\r\n  On his right cheek I put the family kiss,\r\n  And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\r\n  On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.\r\n  (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)\r\n  To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.\r\n  Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\r\n  Let the physician and the priest go home.\r\n  I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\r\n  O despairer, here is my neck,\r\n  By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.\r\n  I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\r\n  Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,\r\n  Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.\r\n  Sleep--I and they keep guard all night,\r\n  Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\r\n  I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\r\n  And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\r\n       41\r\n  I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\r\n  And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\r\n  I heard what was said of the universe,\r\n  Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;\r\n  It is middling well as far as it goes--but is that all?\r\n  Magnifying and applying come I,\r\n  Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\r\n  Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\r\n  Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\r\n  Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\r\n  In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix\r\n      engraved,\r\n  With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,\r\n  Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\r\n  Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\r\n  (They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise and fly\r\n      and sing for themselves,)\r\n  Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,\r\n      bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\r\n  Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\r\n  Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves\r\n      driving the mallet and chisel,\r\n  Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or\r\n      a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,\r\n  Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me\r\n      than the gods of the antique wars,\r\n  Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\r\n  Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their white\r\n      foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\r\n  By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for\r\n      every person born,\r\n  Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels\r\n      with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,\r\n  The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,\r\n  Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his\r\n      brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\r\n  What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and\r\n      not filling the square rod then,\r\n  The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,\r\n  Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,\r\n  The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of\r\n      the supremes,\r\n  The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the\r\n      best, and be as prodigious;\r\n  By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\r\n  Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the shadows.\r\n      42\r\n  A call in the midst of the crowd,\r\n  My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\r\n  Come my children,\r\n  Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,\r\n  Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his prelude on\r\n      the reeds within.\r\n  Easily written loose-finger'd chords--I feel the thrum of your\r\n      climax and close.\r\n  My head slues round on my neck,\r\n  Music rolls, but not from the organ,\r\n  Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\r\n  Ever the hard unsunk ground,\r\n  Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever\r\n      the air and the ceaseless tides,\r\n  Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\r\n  Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb, that\r\n      breath of itches and thirsts,\r\n  Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides\r\n      and bring him forth,\r\n  Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\r\n  Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\r\n  Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\r\n  To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\r\n  Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,\r\n  Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment\r\n      receiving,\r\n  A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\r\n  This is the city and I am one of the citizens,\r\n  Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets,\r\n      newspapers, schools,\r\n  The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,\r\n      stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\r\n  The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail'd coats\r\n  I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)\r\n  I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest\r\n      is deathless with me,\r\n  What I do and say the same waits for them,\r\n  Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.\r\n  I know perfectly well my own egotism,\r\n  Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\r\n  And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\r\n  Not words of routine this song of mine,\r\n  But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\r\n  This printed and bound book--but the printer and the\r\n      printing-office boy?\r\n  The well-taken photographs--but your wife or friend close and solid\r\n      in your arms?\r\n  The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets--but\r\n      the pluck of the captain and engineers?\r\n  In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture--but the host and\r\n      hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\r\n  The sky up there--yet here or next door, or across the way?\r\n  The saints and sages in history--but you yourself?\r\n  Sermons, creeds, theology--but the fathomless human brain,\r\n  And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\r\n       43\r\n  I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\r\n  My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\r\n  Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,\r\n  Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,\r\n  Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,\r\n  Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in\r\n      the circle of obis,\r\n  Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\r\n  Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and\r\n      austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\r\n  Drinking mead from the skull-cap, to Shastas and Vedas admirant,\r\n      minding the Koran,\r\n  Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife,\r\n      beating the serpent-skin drum,\r\n  Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing\r\n      assuredly that he is divine,\r\n  To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting\r\n      patiently in a pew,\r\n  Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till\r\n      my spirit arouses me,\r\n  Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,\r\n  Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\r\n  One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like\r\n      man leaving charges before a journey.\r\n  Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\r\n  Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd, atheistical,\r\n  I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair\r\n      and unbelief.\r\n  How the flukes splash!\r\n  How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!\r\n  Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\r\n  I take my place among you as much as among any,\r\n  The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\r\n  And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely\r\n      the same.\r\n  I do not know what is untried and afterward,\r\n  But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\r\n  Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd, not\r\n      single one can it fall.\r\n  It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried,\r\n  Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\r\n  Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew back\r\n      and was never seen again,\r\n  Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with\r\n      bitterness worse than gall,\r\n  Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\r\n  Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish koboo\r\n      call'd the ordure of humanity,\r\n  Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,\r\n  Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,\r\n  Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads\r\n      that inhabit them,\r\n  Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\r\n       44\r\n  It is time to explain myself--let us stand up.\r\n  What is known I strip away,\r\n  I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\r\n  The clock indicates the moment--but what does eternity indicate?\r\n  We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\r\n  There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\r\n  Births have brought us richness and variety,\r\n  And other births will bring us richness and variety.\r\n  I do not call one greater and one smaller,\r\n  That which fills its period and place is equal to any.\r\n  Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?\r\n  I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\r\n  All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\r\n  (What have I to do with lamentation?)\r\n  I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of things to be.\r\n  My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\r\n  On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,\r\n  All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.\r\n  Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\r\n  Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,\r\n  I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,\r\n  And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\r\n  Long I was hugg'd close--long and long.\r\n  Immense have been the preparations for me,\r\n  Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\r\n  Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,\r\n  For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\r\n  They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\r\n  Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\r\n  My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\r\n  For it the nebula cohered to an orb,\r\n  The long slow strata piled to rest it on,\r\n  Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,\r\n  Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it\r\n      with care.\r\n  All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,\r\n  Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\r\n      45\r\n  O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!\r\n  O manhood, balanced, florid and full.\r\n  My lovers suffocate me,\r\n  Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\r\n  Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,\r\n  Crying by day, Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and\r\n      chirping over my head,\r\n  Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\r\n  Lighting on every moment of my life,\r\n  Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\r\n  Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.\r\n  Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!\r\n  Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows\r\n      after and out of itself,\r\n  And the dark hush promulges as much as any.\r\n  I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\r\n  And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of\r\n      the farther systems.\r\n  Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\r\n  Outward and outward and forever outward.\r\n  My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\r\n  He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\r\n  And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.\r\n  There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\r\n  If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\r\n      were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\r\n      not avail the long run,\r\n  We should surely bring up again where we now stand,\r\n  And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\r\n  A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do\r\n      not hazard the span or make it impatient,\r\n  They are but parts, any thing is but a part.\r\n  See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\r\n  Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\r\n  My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\r\n  The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\r\n  The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.\r\n       46\r\n  I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and\r\n      never will be measured.\r\n  I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\r\n  My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,\r\n  No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\r\n  I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\r\n  I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\r\n  But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\r\n  My left hand hooking you round the waist,\r\n  My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.\r\n  Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\r\n  You must travel it for yourself.\r\n  It is not far, it is within reach,\r\n  Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,\r\n  Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\r\n  Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,\r\n  Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\r\n  If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand\r\n      on my hip,\r\n  And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\r\n  For after we start we never lie by again.\r\n  This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded heaven,\r\n  And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs,\r\n      and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we\r\n      be fill'd and satisfied then?\r\n  And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.\r\n  You are also asking me questions and I hear you,\r\n  I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\r\n  Sit a while dear son,\r\n  Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\r\n  But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you\r\n      with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.\r\n  Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,\r\n  Now I wash the gum from your eyes,\r\n  You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every\r\n      moment of your life.\r\n  Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\r\n  Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,\r\n  To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout,\r\n      and laughingly dash with your hair.\r\n       47\r\n  I am the teacher of athletes,\r\n  He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,\r\n  He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\r\n  The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power,\r\n      but in his own right,\r\n  Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\r\n  Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\r\n  Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,\r\n  First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a\r\n      skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,\r\n  Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over\r\n      all latherers,\r\n  And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.\r\n  I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\r\n  I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\r\n  My words itch at your ears till you understand them.\r\n  I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while\r\n      I wait for a boat,\r\n  (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,\r\n  Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)\r\n  I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,\r\n  And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her\r\n      who privately stays with me in the open air.\r\n  If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,\r\n  The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves key,\r\n  The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\r\n  No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,\r\n  But roughs and little children better than they.\r\n  The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\r\n  The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with\r\n      him all day,\r\n  The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,\r\n  In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen\r\n      and love them.\r\n  The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,\r\n  On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,\r\n  On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\r\n  My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in his blanket,\r\n  The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\r\n  The young mother and old mother comprehend me,\r\n  The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,\r\n  They and all would resume what I have told them.\r\n       48\r\n  I have said that the soul is not more than the body,\r\n  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\r\n  And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,\r\n  And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own\r\n      funeral drest in his shroud,\r\n  And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,\r\n  And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the\r\n      learning of all times,\r\n  And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it\r\n      may become a hero,\r\n  And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,\r\n  And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed\r\n      before a million universes.\r\n  And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\r\n  For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,\r\n  (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and\r\n      about death.)\r\n  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\r\n  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\r\n  Why should I wish to see God better than this day?\r\n  I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,\r\n  In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,\r\n  I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd\r\n      by God's name,\r\n  And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,\r\n  Others will punctually come for ever and ever.\r\n       49\r\n  And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to\r\n      try to alarm me.\r\n  To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\r\n  I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\r\n  I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\r\n  And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\r\n  And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not\r\n      offend me,\r\n  I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\r\n  I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of melons.\r\n  And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,\r\n  (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\r\n  I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\r\n  O suns--O grass of graves--O perpetual transfers and promotions,\r\n  If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\r\n  Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\r\n  Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,\r\n  Toss, sparkles of day and dusk--toss on the black stems that decay\r\n      in the muck,\r\n  Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\r\n  I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\r\n  I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,\r\n  And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\r\n       50\r\n  There is that in me--I do not know what it is--but I know it is in me.\r\n  Wrench'd and sweaty--calm and cool then my body becomes,\r\n  I sleep--I sleep long.\r\n  I do not know it--it is without name--it is a word unsaid,\r\n  It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\r\n  Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\r\n  To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\r\n  Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.\r\n  Do you see O my brothers and sisters?\r\n  It is not chaos or death--it is form, union, plan--it is eternal\r\n      life--it is Happiness.\r\n       51\r\n  The past and present wilt--I have fill'd them, emptied them.\r\n  And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\r\n  Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?\r\n  Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\r\n  (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)\r\n  Do I contradict myself?\r\n  Very well then I contradict myself,\r\n  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)\r\n  I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\r\n  Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?\r\n  Who wishes to walk with me?\r\n  Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?\r\n       52\r\n  The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab\r\n      and my loitering.\r\n  I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\r\n  I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\r\n  The last scud of day holds back for me,\r\n  It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow'd wilds,\r\n  It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\r\n  I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\r\n  I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\r\n  I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\r\n  If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\r\n  You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\r\n  But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\r\n  And filter and fibre your blood.\r\n  Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\r\n  Missing me one place search another,\r\n  I stop somewhere waiting for you.\r\n", "title": "Song of Myself"}

them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.\r\n  Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?\r\n  And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?\r\n  And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?\r\n  And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?\r\n       2\r\n  The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself\r\n      balks account,\r\n  That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\r\n  The expression of the face balks account,\r\n  But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,\r\n  It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of\r\n      his hips and wrists,\r\n  It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist\r\n      and knees, dress does not hide him,\r\n  The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,\r\n  To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,\r\n  You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\r\n  The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the\r\n      folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the\r\n      contour of their shape downwards,\r\n  The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through\r\n      the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls\r\n      silently to and from the heave of the water,\r\n  The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the\r\n      horse-man in his saddle,\r\n  Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\r\n  The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open\r\n      dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,\r\n  The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the garden or\r\n      cow-yard,\r\n  The young fellow hosing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six\r\n      horses through the crowd,\r\n  The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,\r\n      good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,\r\n  The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\r\n  The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\r\n  The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine\r\n      muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\r\n  The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes\r\n      suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,\r\n  The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv'd\r\n      neck and the counting;\r\n  Such-like I love--I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's\r\n      breast with the little child,\r\n  Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with\r\n      the firemen, and pause, listen, count.\r\n       3\r\n  I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,\r\n  And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.\r\n  This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,\r\n  The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and\r\n      beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness\r\n      and breadth of his manners,\r\n  These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,\r\n  He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were\r\n      massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,\r\n  They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,\r\n  They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,\r\n  He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through the\r\n      clear-brown skin of his face,\r\n  He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself, he\r\n      had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had\r\n      fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,\r\n  When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,\r\n      you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,\r\n  You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit\r\n      by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.\r\n       4\r\n  I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,\r\n  To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\r\n  To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\r\n  To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly\r\n      round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?\r\n  I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.\r\n  There is something in staying close to men and women and looking\r\n      on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,\r\n  All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.\r\n       5\r\n  This is the female form,\r\n  A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,\r\n  It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,\r\n  I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor,\r\n      all falls aside but myself and it,\r\n  Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what\r\n      was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed,\r\n  Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response\r\n      likewise ungovernable,\r\n  Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all\r\n      diffused, mine too diffused,\r\n  Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling\r\n      and deliciously aching,\r\n  Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of\r\n      love, white-blow and delirious nice,\r\n  Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,\r\n  Undulating into the willing and yielding day,\r\n  Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.\r\n  This the nucleus--after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,\r\n  This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the\r\n      outlet again.\r\n  Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the\r\n      exit of the rest,\r\n  You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\r\n  The female contains all qualities and tempers them,\r\n  She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,\r\n  She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,\r\n  She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\r\n  As I see my soul reflected in Nature,\r\n  As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,\r\n      sanity, beauty,\r\n  See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.\r\n       6\r\n  The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,\r\n  He too is all qualities, he is action and power,\r\n  The flush of the known universe is in him,\r\n  Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,\r\n  The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is\r\n      utmost become him well, pride is for him,\r\n  The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\r\n  Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to\r\n      the test of himself,\r\n  Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes\r\n      soundings at last only here,\r\n  (Where else does he strike soundings except here?)\r\n  The man's body is sacred and the woman's body is sacred,\r\n  No matter who it is, it is sacred--is it the meanest one in the\r\n      laborers' gang?\r\n  Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?\r\n  Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as\r\n      much as you,\r\n  Each has his or her place in the procession.\r\n  (All is a procession,\r\n  The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)\r\n  Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?\r\n  Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has\r\n      no right to a sight?\r\n  Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and\r\n      the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,\r\n  For you only, and not for him and her?\r\n       7\r\n  A man's body at auction,\r\n  (For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)\r\n  I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.\r\n  Gentlemen look on this wonder,\r\n  Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,\r\n  For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one\r\n      animal or plant,\r\n  For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.\r\n  In this head the all-baffling brain,\r\n  In it and below it the makings of heroes.\r\n  Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in\r\n      tendon and nerve,\r\n  They shall be stript that you may see them.\r\n  Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,\r\n  Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby,\r\n      good-sized arms and legs,\r\n  And wonders within there yet.\r\n  Within there runs blood,\r\n  The same old blood! the same red-running blood!\r\n  There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires,\r\n      reachings, aspirations,\r\n  (Do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in\r\n      parlors and lecture-rooms?)\r\n  This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be\r\n      fathers in their turns,\r\n  In him the start of populous states and rich republics,\r\n  Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.\r\n  How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring\r\n      through the centuries?\r\n  (Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace\r\n      back through the centuries?)\r\n       8\r\n  A woman's body at auction,\r\n  She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,\r\n  She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.\r\n  Have you ever loved the body of a woman?\r\n  Have you ever loved

the earth with all.\r\n  What widens within you Walt Whitman?\r\n  What waves and soils exuding?\r\n  What climes? what persons and cities are here?\r\n  Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?\r\n  Who are the girls? who are the married women?\r\n  Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about\r\n      each other's necks?\r\n  What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\r\n  What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?\r\n  What myriads of dwellings are they fill'd with dwellers?\r\n       2\r\n  Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,\r\n  Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the west,\r\n  Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\r\n  Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends,\r\n  Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings, it\r\n      does not set for months,\r\n  Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above\r\n      the horizon and sinks again,\r\n  Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,\r\n  Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\r\n       3\r\n  What do you hear Walt Whitman?\r\n  I hear the workman singing and the farmer's wife singing,\r\n  I hear in the distance the sounds of children and of animals early\r\n      in the day,\r\n  I hear emulous shouts of Australians pursuing the wild horse,\r\n  I hear the Spanish dance with castanets in the chestnut shade, to\r\n      the rebeck and guitar,\r\n  I hear continual echoes from the Thames,\r\n  I hear fierce French liberty songs,\r\n  I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of old poems,\r\n  I hear the locusts in Syria as they strike the grain and grass with\r\n      the showers of their terrible clouds,\r\n  I hear the Coptic refrain toward sundown, pensively falling on the\r\n      breast of the black venerable vast mother the Nile,\r\n  I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule,\r\n  I hear the Arab muezzin calling from the top of the mosque,\r\n  I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches, I hear\r\n      the responsive base and soprano,\r\n  I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice putting to sea\r\n      at Okotsk,\r\n  I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle as the slaves march on, as the\r\n      husky gangs pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together\r\n      with wrist-chains and ankle-chains,\r\n  I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,\r\n  I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks,

barbarians, tents of nomads upon the surface,\r\n  I see the shaded part on one side where the sleepers are sleeping,\r\n      and the sunlit part on the other side,\r\n  I see the curious rapid change of the light and shade,\r\n  I see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them as\r\n      my land is to me.\r\n  I see plenteous waters,\r\n  I see mountain peaks, I see the

from one to another of its islands,\r\n  The White sea, and the sea around Greenland.\r\n  I behold the mariners of the world,\r\n  Some are in storms, some in the night with the watch on the lookout,\r\n  Some drifting helplessly, some with contagious diseases.\r\n  I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in\r\n      port, some on their voyages,\r\n  Some double the cape of Storms, some cape Verde, others capes\r\n      Guardafui, Bon, or Bajadore,\r\n  Others Dondra head, others pass the straits of Sunda, others cape\r\n      Lopatka, others Behring's straits,\r\n  Others cape Horn, others sail the gulf of Mexico or along Cuba or\r\n      Hayti, others Hudson's bay or Baffin's bay,\r\n  Others pass the straits of Dover, others enter the Wash, others the\r\n      firth of Solway, others round cape Clear, others the Land's End,\r\n  Others traverse the Zuyder Zee or the Scheld,\r\n  Others as comers and goers at Gibraltar or the Dardanelles,\r\n  Others sternly push their way through the northern winter-packs,\r\n  Others descend or ascend the Obi or the Lena,\r\n  Others the Niger or the Congo, others the Indus, the Burampooter\r\n      and Cambodia,\r\n  Others wait steam'd up ready to start in the ports of Australia,\r\n  Wait at Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin, Marseilles, Lisbon, Naples,\r\n  Hamburg, Bremen, Bordeaux, the Hague, Copenhagen,\r\n  Wait at Valparaiso, Rio Janeiro, Panama.\r\n       5\r\n  I see the tracks of the railroads of the earth,\r\n  I see them in Great Britain, I see them in

mistletoe\r\n      and vervain,\r\n  I see the temples of the deaths of the bodies of Gods, I see the old\r\n      signifiers.\r\n  I see Christ eating the bread of his last supper in the midst of\r\n      youths and old persons,\r\n  I see where the strong divine young man the Hercules toil'd\r\n      faithfully and long and then died,\r\n  I see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate of the\r\n      beautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd Bacchus,\r\n  I see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers on\r\n      his head,\r\n  I see Hermes, unsuspected,

celestial sphere where every one goes in his turn.\r\n       7\r\n  I see the battle-fields of the earth, grass grows upon them and\r\n      blossoms and corn,\r\n  I see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.\r\n  I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the unknown\r\n      events, heroes, records of the earth.\r\n  I see the places of the sagas,\r\n  I see pine-trees and fir-trees torn by northern blasts,\r\n  I see granite bowlders and cliffs, I see green meadows and lakes,\r\n  I see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian warriors,\r\n  I see them raised high with stones by the marge of restless oceans,\r\n      that the dead men's spirits when they wearied of their quiet\r\n      graves might rise up through the mounds and gaze on the tossing\r\n      billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity, liberty, action.\r\n  I see the steppes of Asia,\r\n  I see the tumuli of Mongolia, I see the tents of Kalmucks and Baskirs,\r\n  I see the nomadic tribes with herds of oxen and cows,\r\n  I see the table-lands notch'd with ravines, I see the jungles and deserts,\r\n  I see the camel, the wild steed, the bustard, the fat-tail'd sheep,\r\n      the antelope, and the burrowing wolf\r\n  I see the highlands of Abyssinia,\r\n  I see flocks of goats feeding, and see the fig-tree, tamarind, date,\r\n  And see fields of teff-wheat and places of verdure and gold.\r\n  I see the Brazilian vaquero,\r\n  I see the Bolivian ascending mount Sorata,\r\n  I see the Wacho crossing the plains, I see the incomparable rider of\r\n      horses with his lasso on his arm,\r\n  I see over the pampas the pursuit of wild cattle for their hides.\r\n       8\r\n  I see the regions of snow and ice,\r\n  I see the sharp-eyed Samoiede and the Finn,\r\n  I see the seal-seeker in his boat poising his lance,\r\n  I see the Siberian on his slight-built sledge drawn by dogs,\r\n  I see the porpoise-hunters, I see the whale-crews of the south\r\n      Pacific and the north Atlantic,\r\n  I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switzerland--I\r\n      mark the long winters and the isolation.\r\n  I see the cities of the earth and make myself at random a part of them,\r\n  I am a real Parisian,\r\n  I am a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople,\r\n  I am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne,\r\n  I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Limerick,\r\n  I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne,\r\n      Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence,\r\n  I belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw, or northward in Christiania or\r\n      Stockholm, or in Siberian Irkutsk, or in some street in Iceland,\r\n  I descend upon all those cities, and rise from them again.\r\n       10\r\n  I see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries,\r\n  I see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd splint, the\r\n      fetich, and the obi.\r\n  I see African and Asiatic towns,\r\n  I see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuctoo, Monrovia,\r\n  I see the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares, Delhi, Calcutta, Tokio,\r\n  I see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman and Ashantee-man in their huts,\r\n  I see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo,\r\n  I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva and those of Herat,\r\n  I see Teheran, I see Muscat and Medina and the intervening sands,\r\n      see the caravans toiling onward,\r\n  I see Egypt and the Egyptians, I see the pyramids and obelisks.\r\n  I look on chisell'd histories, records of conquering kings,\r\n      dynasties, cut in slabs of sand-stone, or on granite-blocks,\r\n  I see at Memphis mummy-pits containing mummies embalm'd,\r\n      swathed in linen cloth, lying there many centuries,\r\n  I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the\r\n      side-drooping neck, the hands folded across the breast.\r\n  I see all the menials of the earth, laboring,\r\n  I see all the prisoners in the prisons,\r\n  I see the defective human bodies of the earth,\r\n  The blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks, lunatics,\r\n  The pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-makers of the earth,\r\n  The helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women.\r\n  I see male and female everywhere,\r\n  I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs,\r\n  I see the constructiveness of my race,\r\n  I see the results of the perseverance and industry of my race,\r\n  I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, I go among them, I\r\n      mix indiscriminately,\r\n  And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n

{"text": "       1\r\n  Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\r\n  Healthy, free, the world before me,\r\n  The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\r\n  Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\r\n  Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\r\n  Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\r\n  Strong and content I travel the open road.\r\n  The earth, that is sufficient,\r\n  I do not want the constellations any nearer,\r\n  I know they are very well where they are,\r\n  I know they suffice for those who belong to them.\r\n  (Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\r\n  I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\r\n  I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\r\n  I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)\r\n       2\r\n  You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\r\n      that is here,\r\n  I believe that much unseen is also here.\r\n  Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\r\n  The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the\r\n      illiterate person, are not denied;\r\n  The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the\r\n      drunkard's stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\r\n  The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\r\n  The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\r\n      town, the return back from the town,\r\n  They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\r\n  None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\r\n       3\r\n  You air that serves me with breath to speak!\r\n  You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\r\n  You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\r\n  You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\r\n  I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.\r\n  You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\r\n  You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\r\n      side! you distant ships!\r\n  You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd facades! you roofs!\r\n  You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\r\n  You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\r\n  You doors and ascending steps! you arches!\r\n  You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\r\n  From all that has touch'd you I believe you have imparted to\r\n      yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\r\n  From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\r\n      and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\r\n       4\r\n  The earth expanding right hand and left hand,\r\n  The picture alive, every part in its best light,\r\n  The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is\r\n      not wanted,\r\n  The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road.\r\n  O highway I travel, do you say to me Do not leave me?\r\n  Do you say Venture not--if you leave me you are lost?\r\n  Do you say I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied,\r\n      adhere to me?\r\n  O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,\r\n  You express me better than I can express myself,\r\n  You shall be more to me than my poem.\r\n  I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all\r\n      free poems also,\r\n  I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,\r\n  I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever\r\n      beholds me shall like me,\r\n  I think whoever I see must be happy.\r\n       5\r\n  From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines,\r\n  Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,\r\n  Listening to others, considering well what they say,\r\n  Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\r\n  Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\r\n      would hold me.\r\n  I inhale great draughts of space,\r\n  The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\r\n  I am larger, better than I thought,\r\n  I did not know I held so much goodness.\r\n  All seems beautiful to me,\r\n  can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me\r\n      I would do the same to you,\r\n  I will recruit for myself and you as I go,\r\n  I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,\r\n  I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\r\n  Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,\r\n  Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\r\n       6\r\n  Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\r\n  Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it would not\r\n      astonish me.\r\n  Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,\r\n  It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\r\n  Here a great personal deed has room,\r\n  (Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,\r\n  Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\r\n      authority and all argument against it.)\r\n  Here is the test of wisdom,\r\n  Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,\r\n  Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not having it,\r\n  Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\r\n  Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\r\n  Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\r\n      excellence of things;\r\n  Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\r\n      it out of the soul.\r\n  Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,\r\n  They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\r\n      spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\r\n  Here is realization,\r\n  Here is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\r\n  The past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\r\n      are vacant of them.\r\n  Only the kernel of every object nourishes;\r\n  Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\r\n  Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\r\n  Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is apropos;\r\n  Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\r\n  Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\r\n       7\r\n  Here is the efflux of the soul,\r\n  The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd gates,\r\n      ever provoking questions,\r\n  These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\r\n  Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\r\n      expands my blood?\r\n  Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\r\n  Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\r\n      thoughts descend upon me?\r\n  (I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\r\n      drop fruit as I pass;)\r\n  What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\r\n  What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\r\n  What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\r\n      and pause?\r\n  What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's good-will? what\r\n      gives them to be free to mine?\r\n       8\r\n  The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\r\n  I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\r\n  Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\r\n  Here rises the fluid and attaching character,\r\n  The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\r\n      man and woman,\r\n  (The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\r\n      out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\r\n      continually out of itself.)\r\n  Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\r\n      love of young and old,\r\n  From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\r\n  Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\r\n       9\r\n  Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!\r\n  Traveling with me you find what never tires.\r\n  The earth never tires,\r\n  The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude\r\n      and incomprehensible at first,\r\n  Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop'd,\r\n  I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\r\n  Allons! we must not stop here,\r\n  However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling\r\n      we cannot remain here,\r\n  However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters we must\r\n      not anchor here,\r\n  However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are permitted\r\n      to receive it but a little while.\r\n       10\r\n  Allons! the inducements shall be greater,\r\n  We will sail pathless and wild seas,\r\n  We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee clipper\r\n      speeds by under full sail.\r\n  Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,\r\n  Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;\r\n  Allons! from all formules!\r\n  From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.\r\n  The stale cadaver blocks up the passage--the burial waits no longer.\r\n  Allons! yet take warning!\r\n  He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,\r\n  None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,\r\n  Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,\r\n  Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,\r\n  No diseas'd person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here.\r\n  (I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,\r\n  We convince by our presence.)\r\n       11\r\n  Listen! I will be honest with you,\r\n  I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,\r\n  These are the days that must happen to you:\r\n  You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,\r\n  You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,\r\n  You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you hardly\r\n      settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call'd by an\r\n      irresistible call to depart,\r\n  You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those\r\n      who remain behind you,\r\n  What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with\r\n      passionate kisses of parting,\r\n  You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands\r\n      toward you.\r\n       12\r\n  Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!\r\n  They too are on the road--they are the swift and majestic men--they\r\n      are the greatest women,\r\n  Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,\r\n  Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,\r\n  Habitues of many distant countries, habitues of far-distant dwellings,\r\n  Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers,\r\n  Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore,\r\n  Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of\r\n      children, bearers of children,\r\n  Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down of coffins,\r\n  Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the curious\r\n      years each emerging from that which preceded it,\r\n  Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse phases,\r\n  Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,\r\n  Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their bearded\r\n      and well-grain'd manhood,\r\n  Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content,\r\n  Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood,\r\n  Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe,\r\n  Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death.\r\n       13\r\n  Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,\r\n  To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,\r\n  To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights\r\n      they tend to,\r\n  Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,\r\n  To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,\r\n  To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it,\r\n  To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you,\r\n      however long but it stretches and waits for you,\r\n  To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,\r\n  To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without\r\n      labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one\r\n      particle of it,\r\n  To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant\r\n      villa, and the chaste blessings of the well-married couple, and\r\n      the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens,\r\n  To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through,\r\n  To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,\r\n  To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter\r\n      them, to gather the love out of their hearts,\r\n  To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave\r\n      them behind you,\r\n  To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for\r\n      traveling souls.\r\n  All parts away for the progress of souls,\r\n  All religion, all solid things, arts, governments--all that was or is\r\n      apparent upon this globe or any globe, falls into niches and corners\r\n      before the procession of souls along the grand roads of the universe.\r\n  Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of\r\n      the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance.\r\n  Forever alive, forever forward,\r\n  Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble,\r\n      dissatisfied,\r\n  Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men,\r\n  They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where they go,\r\n  But I know that they go toward the best--toward something great.\r\n  Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!\r\n  You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though\r\n      you built it, or though it has been built for you.\r\n  Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!\r\n  It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.\r\n  Behold through you as bad as the rest,\r\n  Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,\r\n  Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces,\r\n  Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.\r\n  No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,\r\n  Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,\r\n  Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and\r\n      bland in the parlors,\r\n  In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,\r\n  Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom,\r\n      everywhere,\r\n  Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the\r\n      breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,\r\n  Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers,\r\n  Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself,\r\n  Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.\r\n       14\r\n  Allons! through struggles and wars!\r\n  The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.\r\n  Have the past struggles succeeded?\r\n  What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?\r\n  Now understand me well--it is provided in the essence of things that\r\n      from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth\r\n      something to make a greater struggle necessary.\r\n  My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,\r\n  He going with me must go well arm'd,\r\n  He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies,\r\n      desertions.\r\n       15\r\n  Allons! the road is before us!\r\n  It is safe--I have tried it--my own feet have tried it well--be not\r\n      detain'd!\r\n  Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the\r\n      shelf unopen'd!\r\n  Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd!\r\n  Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!\r\n  Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the\r\n      court, and the judge expound the law.\r\n  Camerado, I give you my hand!\r\n  I give you my love more precious than money,\r\n  I give you myself before preaching or law;\r\n  Will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me?\r\n  Shall we stick by each other as long as we live?\r\n", "title": "Song of the Open Road"}
{"text": "       1\r\n  Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!\r\n  Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face\r\n      to face.\r\n  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious\r\n      you are to me!\r\n  On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning\r\n      home, are more curious to me than you suppose,\r\n  And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more\r\n      to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\r\n       2\r\n  The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\r\n  The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every\r\n      one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,\r\n  The similitudes of the past and those of the future,\r\n  The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on\r\n      the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\r\n  The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\r\n  The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\r\n  The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\r\n  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\r\n  Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,\r\n  Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the\r\n      heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\r\n  Others will see the islands large and small;\r\n  Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half\r\n      an hour high,\r\n  A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others\r\n      will see them,\r\n  Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the\r\n      falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.\r\n       3\r\n  It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,\r\n  I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many\r\n      generations hence,\r\n  Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,\r\n  Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,\r\n  Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the\r\n      bright flow, I was refresh'd,\r\n  Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift\r\n      current, I stood yet was hurried,\r\n  Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the\r\n      thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.\r\n  I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,\r\n  Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air\r\n      floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,\r\n  Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left\r\n      the rest in strong shadow,\r\n  Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,\r\n  Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,\r\n  Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,\r\n  Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my\r\n      head in the sunlit water,\r\n  Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,\r\n  Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,\r\n  Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,\r\n  Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,\r\n  Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,\r\n  The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,\r\n  The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender\r\n      serpentine pennants,\r\n  The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,\r\n  The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\r\n  The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,\r\n  The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the\r\n      frolic-some crests and glistening,\r\n  The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the\r\n      granite storehouses by the docks,\r\n  On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on\r\n      each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\r\n  On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning\r\n      high and glaringly into the night,\r\n  Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow\r\n      light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\r\n       4\r\n  These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\r\n  I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\r\n  The men and women I saw were all near to me,\r\n  Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward\r\n      to them,\r\n  (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\r\n       5\r\n  What is it then between us?\r\n  What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\r\n  Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,\r\n  I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\r\n  I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the\r\n      waters around it,\r\n  I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\r\n  In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\r\n  In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\r\n  I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\r\n  I too had receiv'd identity by my body,\r\n  That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I\r\n      should be of my body.\r\n       6\r\n  It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\r\n  The dark threw its patches down upon me also,\r\n  The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,\r\n  My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?\r\n  Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,\r\n  I am he who knew what it was to be evil,\r\n  I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\r\n  Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,\r\n  Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\r\n  Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,\r\n  The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.\r\n  The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\r\n  Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,\r\n  Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,\r\n  Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as\r\n      they saw me approaching or passing,\r\n  Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of\r\n      their flesh against me as I sat,\r\n  Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet\r\n      never told them a word,\r\n  Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\r\n  Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\r\n  The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\r\n  Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\r\n       7\r\n  Closer yet I approach you,\r\n  What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my\r\n      stores in advance,\r\n  I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.\r\n  Who was to know what should come home to me?\r\n  Who knows but I am enjoying this?\r\n  Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you\r\n      now, for all you cannot see me?\r\n       8\r\n  Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than\r\n      mast-hemm'd Manhattan?\r\n  River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?\r\n  The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the\r\n      twilight, and the belated lighter?\r\n  What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I\r\n      love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?\r\n  What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that\r\n      looks in my face?\r\n  Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\r\n  We understand then do we not?\r\n  What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\r\n  What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not\r\n      accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?\r\n       9\r\n  Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\r\n  Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!\r\n  Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the\r\n      men and women generations after me!\r\n  Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\r\n  Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\r\n  Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\r\n  Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\r\n  Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!\r\n  Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my\r\n      nighest name!\r\n  Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\r\n  Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one\r\n      makes it!\r\n  Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be\r\n      looking upon you;\r\n  Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet\r\n      haste with the hasting current;\r\n  Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\r\n  Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all\r\n      downcast eyes have time to take it from you!\r\n  Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any\r\n      one's head, in the sunlit water!\r\n  Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd\r\n      schooners, sloops, lighters!\r\n  Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!\r\n  Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at\r\n      nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\r\n  Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\r\n  You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\r\n  About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,\r\n  Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and\r\n      sufficient rivers,\r\n  Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\r\n  Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\r\n  You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,\r\n  We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,\r\n  Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,\r\n  We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,\r\n  We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,\r\n  You furnish your parts toward eternity,\r\n  Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.\r\n", "title": "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry"}

to the President\r\n      at his levee,\r\n  And he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\r\n  And both understand him and know that his speech is right.\r\n  He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,\r\n  He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\r\n      Here is our equal appearing and new.\r\n  Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\r\n  And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\r\n      he has follow'd the sea,\r\n  And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\r\n  And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\r\n  No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\r\n      follow'd it,\r\n  No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\r\n      sisters there.\r\n  The English believe he comes of their English stock,\r\n  A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,\r\n      removed from none.\r\n  Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,\r\n  The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard\r\n      is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,\r\n  The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi\r\n      or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.\r\n  The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,\r\n  The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see\r\n      themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,\r\n  They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.\r\n       2\r\n  The indications and tally of time,\r\n  Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,\r\n  Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,\r\n  What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company\r\n      of singers, and their words,\r\n  The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark,\r\n      but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,\r\n  The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\r\n  His insight and power encircle things and the human race,\r\n  He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\r\n  The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\r\n  The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough, but rare\r\n      has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\r\n      of poems, the Answerer,\r\n  (Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd such a\r\n      day, for all its names.)\r\n  The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\r\n      names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\r\n  The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\r\n      sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\r\n      weird-singer, or something else.\r\n  All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\r\n  The words of true poems do not merely please,\r\n  The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\r\n  The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\r\n      and fathers,\r\n  The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\r\n  Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\r\n      rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\r\n  Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\r\n  The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\r\n  The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\r\n      these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\r\n  The words of the true poems give you more than poems,\r\n  They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\r\n      peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\r\n  They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\r\n  They do not seek beauty, they are sought,\r\n  Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\r\n      fain, love-sick.\r\n  They prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\r\n  They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\r\n  Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\r\n      learn one of the meanings,\r\n  To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\r\n      rings and never be quiet again.\r\n", "title": "Song of the Answerer"}

sentinels--and I feeding and taking turns\r\n      with the rest,\r\n  In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,\r\n      rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his\r\n      fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--and I, plunging at the\r\n      hunters, corner'd and desperate,\r\n  In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the\r\n      countless workmen working in the shops,\r\n  And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself\r\n      than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,\r\n  Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more\r\n      inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a thousand\r\n      diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands\r\n      are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY;\r\n  Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,\r\n  Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these me,\r\n  These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me\r\n      and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the union\r\n      of them, to afford the like to you?\r\n  Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you\r\n      also be eligible as I am?\r\n  How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect\r\n      bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?\r\n", "title": "Our Old Feuillage"}

what bloom more\r\n      than the bloom of youth?\r\n  What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?\r\n  O the orator's joys!\r\n  To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the\r\n      ribs and throat,\r\n  To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,\r\n  To lead America--to quell America with a great tongue.\r\n  O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity through\r\n      materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them,\r\n  My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,\r\n      reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,\r\n  The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,\r\n  My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,\r\n  Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes\r\n      which finally see,\r\n  Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,\r\n      embraces, procreates.\r\n  O the farmer's joys!\r\n  Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,\r\n      Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!\r\n  To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,\r\n  To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,\r\n  To plough land in the spring for maize,\r\n  To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.\r\n  O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,\r\n  To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the shore.\r\n  O to realize space!\r\n  The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,\r\n  To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying\r\n      clouds, as one with them.\r\n  O the joy a manly self-hood!\r\n  To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or unknown,\r\n  To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,\r\n  To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,\r\n  To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,\r\n  To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth.\r\n  Knowist thou the excellent joys of youth?\r\n  Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face?\r\n  Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?\r\n  Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?\r\n  Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?\r\n  Yet O my soul supreme!\r\n  Knowist thou the joys of pensive thought?\r\n  Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?\r\n  Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the suffering\r\n      and the struggle?\r\n  The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day\r\n      or night?\r\n  Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?\r\n  Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,\r\n      the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?\r\n  Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.\r\n  O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,\r\n  To meet life as a powerful conqueror,\r\n  No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,\r\n  To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving\r\n      my interior soul impregnable,\r\n  And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.\r\n  For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating--the joy of death!\r\n  The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,\r\n      for reasons,\r\n  Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd\r\n      to powder, or buried,\r\n  My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,\r\n  My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,\r\n      further offices, eternal uses of the earth.\r\n  O to attract by more than attraction!\r\n  How it is I know not--yet behold! the something which obeys none\r\n      of the rest,\r\n  It is offensive, never defensive--yet how magnetic it draws.\r\n  O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!\r\n  To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!\r\n  To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!\r\n  To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with\r\n      perfect nonchalance!\r\n  To be indeed a God!\r\n  O to sail to sea in a ship!\r\n  To leave this steady unendurable land,\r\n  To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the\r\n      houses,\r\n  To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,\r\n  To sail and sail and sail!\r\n  O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!\r\n  To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!\r\n  To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,\r\n  A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)\r\n  A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.\r\n", "title": "A Song of Joys"}

cherish'd for themselves,\r\n  They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for them,\r\n  The show passes, all does well enough of course,\r\n  All does very well till one flash of defiance.\r\n  A great city is that which has the greatest men and women,\r\n  If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the\r\n      whole world.\r\n       5\r\n  The place where a great city stands is not the place of stretch'd\r\n      wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce merely,\r\n  Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers or the\r\n      anchor-lifters of the departing,\r\n  Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops\r\n      selling goods from the rest of the earth,\r\n  Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place where\r\n      money is plentiest,\r\n  Nor the place of the most numerous population.\r\n  Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards,\r\n  Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them in\r\n      return and understands them,\r\n  Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds,\r\n  Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,\r\n  Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,\r\n  Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,\r\n  Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending audacity of\r\n      elected persons,\r\n  Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of\r\n      death pours its sweeping and unript waves,\r\n  Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside\r\n      authority,\r\n  Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President,\r\n      Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for pay,\r\n  Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on\r\n      themselves,\r\n  Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,\r\n  Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,\r\n  Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men,\r\n  Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men;\r\n  Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,\r\n  Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,\r\n  Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,\r\n  Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,\r\n  There the great city stands.\r\n       6\r\n  How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!\r\n  How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a\r\n      man's or woman's look!\r\n  All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;\r\n  A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of the universe,\r\n  When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,\r\n  The dispute on the soul stops,\r\n  The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back, or laid away.\r\n  What is your money-making now? what can it do now?\r\n  What is your respectability now?\r\n  What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-books, now?\r\n  Where are your jibes of being now?\r\n  Where are your cavils about the soul now?\r\n       7\r\n  A sterile landscape covers the ore, there is as good as the best for\r\n      all the forbidding appearance,\r\n  There is the mine, there are the miners,\r\n  The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accomplish'd, the hammersmen\r\n      are at hand with their tongs and hammers,\r\n  What always served and always serves is at hand.\r\n  Than this nothing has better served, it has served all,\r\n  Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and long ere the Greek,\r\n  Served in building the buildings that last longer than any,\r\n  Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindustanee,\r\n  Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi, served those whose\r\n      relics remain in Central America,\r\n  Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars and\r\n      the druids,\r\n  Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the\r\n      snow-cover'd hills of Scandinavia,\r\n  Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls rough\r\n      sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, ocean waves,\r\n  Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the pastoral\r\n      tribes and nomads,\r\n  Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,\r\n  Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of Ethiopia,\r\n  Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the\r\n      making of those for war,\r\n  Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea,\r\n  For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages,\r\n  Served not the living only then as now, but served the dead.\r\n       8\r\n  I see the European headsman,\r\n  He stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked arms,\r\n  And leans on a ponderous axe.\r\n  (Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?\r\n  Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)\r\n  I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,\r\n  I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,\r\n  Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers, rejected kings,\r\n  Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.\r\n  I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,\r\n  The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out,\r\n  (Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out.)\r\n  I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,\r\n  Both blade and helve are clean,\r\n  They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp no more\r\n      the necks of queens.\r\n  I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,\r\n  I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any axe upon it,\r\n  I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race,\r\n      the newest, largest race.\r\n       9\r\n  (America! I do not vaunt my love for you,\r\n  I have what I have.)\r\n  The axe leaps!\r\n  The solid forest gives fluid utterances,\r\n  They tumble forth, they rise and form,\r\n  Hut, tent, landing, survey,\r\n  Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade,\r\n  Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, lamb, lath, panel, gable,\r\n  Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibition-house, library,\r\n  Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, turret, porch,\r\n  Hoe, rake, pitchfork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw, jack-plane, mallet,\r\n      wedge, rounce,\r\n  Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor,\r\n  Work-box, chest, string'd instrument, boat, frame, and what not,\r\n  Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of States,\r\n  Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for orphans or for the poor or sick,\r\n  Manhattan steamboats and clippers taking the measure of all seas.\r\n  The shapes arise!\r\n  Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users and all that\r\n      neighbors them,\r\n  Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kenebec,\r\n  Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little\r\n      lakes, or on the Columbia,\r\n  Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande, friendly\r\n      gatherings, the characters and fun,\r\n  Dwellers along the St. Lawrence, or north in Kanada, or down by the\r\n      Yellowstone, dwellers on coasts and off coasts,\r\n  Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice.\r\n  The shapes arise!\r\n  Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets,\r\n  Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads,\r\n  Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches,\r\n  Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake and canal craft, river craft,\r\n  Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Eastern and Western seas, and in\r\n      many a bay and by-place,\r\n  The live-oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the\r\n      hackmatack-roots for knees,\r\n  The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the\r\n      workmen busy outside and inside,\r\n  The tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze,\r\n      bolt, line, square, gouge, and bead-plane.\r\n       10\r\n  The shapes arise!\r\n  The shape measur'd, saw'd, jack'd, join'd, stain'd,\r\n  The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud,\r\n  The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of\r\n      the bride's bed,\r\n  The shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath,\r\n      the shape of the babe's cradle,\r\n  The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for dancers' feet,\r\n  The shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the friendly\r\n      parents and children,\r\n  The shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and\r\n      woman, the roof over the well-married young man and woman,\r\n  The roof over the supper joyously cook'd by the chaste wife, and joyously\r\n      eaten by the chaste husband, content after his day's work.\r\n  The shapes arise!\r\n  The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, and of him or\r\n      her seated in the place,\r\n  The shape of the liquor-bar lean'd against by the young rum-drinker\r\n      and the old rum-drinker,\r\n  The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking foot- steps,\r\n  The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple,\r\n  The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish winnings and losings,\r\n  The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and sentenced\r\n      murderer, the murderer with haggard face and pinion'd arms,\r\n  The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipp'd\r\n      crowd, the dangling of the rope.\r\n  The shapes arise!\r\n  Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances,\r\n  The door passing the dissever'd friend flush'd and in haste,\r\n  The door that admits good news and bad news,\r\n  The door whence the son left home confident and puff'd up,\r\n  The door he enter'd again from a long and scandalous absence,\r\n      diseas'd, broken down, without innocence, without means.\r\n       11\r\n  Her shape arises,\r\n  She less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever,\r\n  The gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross and soil'd,\r\n  She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is conceal'd from her,\r\n  She is none the less considerate or friendly therefor,\r\n  She is the best belov'd, it is without exception, she has no reason\r\n      to fear and she does not fear,\r\n  Oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to\r\n      her as she passes,\r\n  She is silent, she is possess'd of herself, they do not offend her,\r\n  She receives them as the laws of Nature receive them, she is strong,\r\n  She too is a law of Nature--there is no law stronger than she is.\r\n       12\r\n  The main shapes arise!\r\n

{"text": "       1\r\n  A California song,\r\n  A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,\r\n  A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,\r\n  A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,\r\n  Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.\r\n  Farewell my brethren,\r\n  Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,\r\n  My time has ended, my term has come.\r\n  Along the northern coast,\r\n  Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,\r\n  In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,\r\n  With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,\r\n  With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,\r\n  Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood\r\n      forest dense,\r\n  I heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.\r\n  The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,\r\n  The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,\r\n  As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to\r\n      join the refrain,\r\n  But in my soul I plainly heard.\r\n  Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,\r\n  Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,\r\n  Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,\r\n  That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but\r\n      the future.\r\n  You untold life of me,\r\n  And all you venerable and innocent joys,\r\n  Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and many a summer sun,\r\n  And the white snows and night and the wild winds;\r\n  O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys unreck'd by man,\r\n  (For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,\r\n  And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)\r\n  Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,\r\n  Our time, our term has come.\r\n  Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,\r\n  We who have grandly fill'd our time,\r\n  With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,\r\n  We welcome what we wrought for through the past,\r\n  And leave the field for them.\r\n  For them predicted long,\r\n  For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,\r\n  For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings.'\r\n  In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,\r\n  These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,\r\n  To be in them absorb'd, assimilated.\r\n  Then to a loftier strain,\r\n  Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,\r\n  As if the heirs, the deities of the West,\r\n  Joining with master-tongue bore part.\r\n  Not wan from Asia's fetiches,\r\n  Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house,\r\n  (Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and\r\n      scaffolds everywhere,\r\n  But come from Nature's long and harmless throes, peacefully builded thence,\r\n  These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,\r\n  To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,\r\n  You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate.\r\n  You occult deep volitions,\r\n  You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself,\r\n      giving not taking law,\r\n  You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and\r\n      love and aught that comes from life and love,\r\n  You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, age\r\n      upon age working in death the same as life,)\r\n  You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould\r\n      the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,\r\n  You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd but ever alert,\r\n  You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be\r\n      unconscious of yourselves,\r\n  Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;\r\n  You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts,\r\n      statutes, literatures,\r\n  Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire,\r\n      lands of the Western shore,\r\n  We pledge, we dedicate to you.\r\n  For man of you, your characteristic race,\r\n  Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportionate to Nature,\r\n  Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or roof,\r\n  Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,\r\n  Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas heed,)\r\n  here fill his time,\r\n  To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last,\r\n  To disappear, to serve.\r\n  Thus on the northern coast,\r\n  In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and the\r\n      music of choppers' axes,\r\n  The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,\r\n  Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic,\r\n      ancient and rustling,\r\n  The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,\r\n  All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,\r\n  From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,\r\n  To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,\r\n  The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the\r\n      settlements, features all,\r\n  In the Mendocino woods I caught.\r\n       2\r\n  The flashing and golden pageant of California,\r\n  The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,\r\n  The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado south,\r\n  Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain cliffs,\r\n  The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent, cyclic chemistry,\r\n  The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface ripening,\r\n      the rich ores forming beneath;\r\n  At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,\r\n  A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,\r\n  Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the\r\n      whole world,\r\n  To India and China and Australia and the thousand island paradises\r\n      of the Pacific,\r\n  Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the rivers,\r\n      the railroads, with many a thrifty farm, with machinery,\r\n  And wool and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.\r\n       3\r\n  But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,\r\n  (These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)\r\n  I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years,\r\n      till now deferr'd,\r\n  Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race.\r\n  The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,\r\n  In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart trees imperial,\r\n  In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or even vital air.\r\n  Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,\r\n  I see the genius of the modern, child of the

Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,\r\n  The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\r\n      their guns,\r\n  That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.\r\n  The General watch'd them from this hill,\r\n  They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\r\n  Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\r\n  But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\r\n  It sickens me yet, that slaughter!\r\n  I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\r\n  I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\r\n  Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,\r\n  But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.\r\n  We fought the fight in detachments,\r\n  Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\r\n      against us,\r\n  Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back\r\n      to the works on this hill,\r\n  Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.\r\n  That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand\r\n      strong,\r\n  Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\r\n  That and here my General's first battle,\r\n  No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude\r\n      with applause,\r\n  Nobody clapp'd hands here then.\r\n  But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\r\n  Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,\r\n  While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us encamp'd,\r\n  Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\r\n      their victory.\r\n  So dull and damp and another day,\r\n  But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\r\n  Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\r\n      General retreated.\r\n  I saw him at the river-side,\r\n  Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\r\n  My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,\r\n  And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for\r\n      the last time.\r\n  Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,\r\n  Many no doubt thought of capitulation.\r\n  But when my General pass'd me,\r\n  As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,\r\n  I saw something different from capitulation.\r\n       [Terminus]\r\n  Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,\r\n  The two, the past and present, have interchanged,\r\n  I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\r\n  And is this the ground Washington trod?\r\n  And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross'd,\r\n  As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\r\n  I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\r\n  I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.\r\n  See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\r\n  It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\r\n  The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\r\n      Washington's face,\r\n  The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept\r\n      the enemy,\r\n  They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\r\n  Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\r\n  Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds.\r\n  In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.\r\n  Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable\r\n      than your owners supposed;\r\n  In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,\r\n  Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.\r\n", "title": "The Centenarian's Story"}

15\r\n  To the tally of my soul,\r\n  Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\r\n  With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\r\n  Loud in the pines and cedars dim,\r\n  Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\r\n  And I with my comrades there in the night.\r\n  While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\r\n  As to long panoramas of visions.\r\n  And I saw askant the armies,\r\n  I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\r\n  Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc'd with missiles I saw them,\r\n  And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\r\n  And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\r\n  And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.\r\n  I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\r\n  And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\r\n  I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\r\n  But I saw they were not as was thought,\r\n  They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,\r\n  The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,\r\n  And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,\r\n  And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.\r\n       16\r\n  Passing the visions, passing the night,\r\n  Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,\r\n  Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\r\n  Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\r\n  As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,\r\n      flooding the night,\r\n  Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again\r\n      bursting with joy,\r\n  Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\r\n  As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\r\n  Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\r\n  I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\r\n  I cease from my song for thee,\r\n  From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\r\n  O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\r\n  Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\r\n  The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\r\n  And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,\r\n  With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\r\n  With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\r\n  Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for\r\n      the dead I loved so well,\r\n  For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this for\r\n      his dear sake,\r\n  Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\r\n  There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.\r\n", "title": "When

ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety of\r\n      ourselves,\r\n  We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,\r\n  We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world,\r\n  From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.\r\n  Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,\r\n  Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or\r\n

immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work and\r\n      pass'd to other spheres,\r\n  A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.\r\n  America, curious toward foreign

with\r\n      incomparable love,\r\n  Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,\r\n  Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,\r\n  Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,\r\n  Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,\r\n      Niagara, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly in him,\r\n  If the Atlantic coast stretch or the Pacific coast stretch, he\r\n      stretching with them North or South,\r\n  Spanning between them East and West, and touching whatever is between them,\r\n  Growths growing from him to offset the growths of pine, cedar, hemlock,\r\n      live-oak, locust, chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,\r\n  Tangles as tangled in him as any canebrake or swamp,\r\n  He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with\r\n      northern transparent ice,\r\n  Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,\r\n  Through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the\r\n      fish-hawk, mocking-bird, night-heron, and eagle,\r\n  His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil,\r\n  Surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,\r\n  Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,\r\n  Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,\r\n  The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the formation of\r\n      the Constitution,\r\n  The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the immigrants,\r\n  The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure and impregnable,\r\n  The unsurvey'd interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals,\r\n      hunters, trappers,\r\n  Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the\r\n      gestation of new States,\r\n  Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming\r\n      up from the uttermost parts,\r\n  Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially\r\n      the young men,\r\n  Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships, the gait they\r\n      have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the\r\n      presence of superiors,\r\n  The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and\r\n      decision of their phrenology,\r\n  The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong'd,\r\n  The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity,\r\n      good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite make,\r\n  The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,\r\n  The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement\r\n      of the population,\r\n  The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,\r\n  Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points,\r\n  Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the Northeast,\r\n      Northwest, Southwest,\r\n  Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,\r\n  Slavery--the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the\r\n      ruins of all the rest,\r\n  On and on to the grapple with

Phantom by Ontario's shore,\r\n  I heard the voice arising demanding bards,\r\n  By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be\r\n      fused into the compact organism of a Nation.\r\n  To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,\r\n  That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle,\r\n      as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.\r\n  Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most\r\n      need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest,\r\n  Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their\r\n      poets shall.\r\n  (Soul of love and tongue of fire!\r\n  Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!\r\n  Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren, barren?)\r\n       10\r\n  Of these States the poet is the equable man,\r\n  Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of\r\n      their full returns,\r\n  Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,\r\n  He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither\r\n      more nor less,\r\n  He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,\r\n  He is the equalizer of his age and land,\r\n  He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,\r\n  In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,\r\n      thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts,\r\n      commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health,\r\n      immortality, government,\r\n  In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as\r\n      good as the engineer's, he can make every word he speaks draw blood,\r\n  The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,\r\n  He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)\r\n  He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun failing round\r\n      helpless thing,\r\n  As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,\r\n  His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,\r\n  In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,\r\n  He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,\r\n  He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women\r\n      as dreams or dots.\r\n  For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,\r\n  For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,\r\n  The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.\r\n  Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,\r\n  They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,\r\n  (Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always\r\n      ready to fall for Liberty.)\r\n       11\r\n  For the great Idea,\r\n  That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.\r\n  Songs of stern defiance ever ready,\r\n  Songs of the rapid arming and the march,\r\n  The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,\r\n  Warlike flag of the great Idea.\r\n  (Angry cloth I saw there leaping!\r\n  I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,\r\n  I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight--O the\r\n      hard-contested fight!\r\n  The cannons ope their rosy-flashing muzzles--the hurtled balls scream,\r\n  The battle-front forms amid the smoke--the volleys pour incessant\r\n      from the line,\r\n  Hark, the ringing word Charge!--now the tussle and the furious\r\n      maddening yells,\r\n  Now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground,\r\n  Cold, cold in death, for precious life of you,\r\n  Angry cloth I saw there leaping.)\r\n       12\r\n  Are you he who would assume a place to teach or be a poet

faithful to things? do you teach what the land and sea, the\r\n      bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness, heroic angers, teach?\r\n  Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?\r\n  Can

or mere religion?\r\n  Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to\r\n      life itself?\r\n  Have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these States?\r\n  Have you too the old ever-fresh forbearance and impartiality?\r\n  Do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity? for the\r\n      last-born? little and big? and for the errant?\r\n  What is this you bring my America?\r\n  Is it uniform with my country?\r\n  Is it not something that has been better told or done before?\r\n  Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship?\r\n  Is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness?--Is the good old cause in it?\r\n  Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,\r\n      literats, of enemies' lands?\r\n  Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here?\r\n  Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?\r\n  Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the Union in\r\n      that secession war?\r\n  Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?\r\n  Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again in my\r\n      strength, gait, face?\r\n  Have real employments contributed to it? original makers, not mere\r\n      amanuenses?\r\n  Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?\r\n  What does it mean to American persons,

{"text": "       1\r\n  I wander all night in my vision,\r\n  Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,\r\n  Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,\r\n  Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,\r\n  Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.\r\n  How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,\r\n  How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.\r\n  The wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the\r\n      livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,\r\n  The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their\r\n      strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging\r\n      from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,\r\n  The night pervades them and infolds them.\r\n  The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on\r\n      the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,\r\n  The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,\r\n  The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,\r\n  And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.\r\n  The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,\r\n  The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,\r\n  The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?\r\n  And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?\r\n  The female that loves unrequited sleeps,\r\n  And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,\r\n  The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,\r\n  And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.\r\n  I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and\r\n      the most restless,\r\n  I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,\r\n  The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.\r\n  Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,\r\n  The earth recedes from me into the night,\r\n  I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is\r\n      beautiful.\r\n  I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers\r\n      each in turn,\r\n  I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,\r\n  And I become the other dreamers.\r\n  I am a dance--play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!\r\n  I am the ever-laughing--it is new moon and twilight,\r\n  I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way look,\r\n  Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is\r\n      neither ground nor sea.\r\n  Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,\r\n  Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,\r\n  I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,\r\n  And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,\r\n  To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and\r\n      resume the way;\r\n  Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting\r\n      music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!\r\n  I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,\r\n  The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,\r\n  He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,\r\n  The stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person.\r\n  I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,\r\n  My truant lover has come, and it is dark.\r\n  Double yourself and receive me darkness,\r\n  Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.\r\n  I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.\r\n  He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,\r\n  He rises with me silently from the bed.\r\n  Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,\r\n  I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.\r\n  My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,\r\n  I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.\r\n  Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?\r\n  I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,\r\n  I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.\r\n       2\r\n  I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\r\n  Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.\r\n  It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,\r\n  I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's\r\n      stockings.\r\n  It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,\r\n  I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\r\n  A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,\r\n  It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is\r\n      blank here, for reasons.\r\n  (It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy,\r\n  Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.)\r\n       3\r\n  I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies\r\n      of the sea,\r\n  His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with\r\n      courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,\r\n  I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,\r\n  I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on\r\n      the rocks.\r\n  What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\r\n  Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime\r\n      of his middle age?\r\n  Steady and long he struggles,\r\n  He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength\r\n      holds out,\r\n  The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,\r\n      they roll him, swing him, turn him,\r\n  His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is\r\n      continually bruis'd on rocks,\r\n  Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.\r\n       4\r\n  I turn but do not extricate myself,\r\n  Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\r\n  The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,\r\n  The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\r\n  I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as\r\n      she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.\r\n  I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\r\n  I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\r\n  I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us alive,\r\n  In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\r\n       5\r\n  Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\r\n  Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd\r\n      hills amid a crowd of officers.\r\n  His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,\r\n  He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd\r\n      from his cheeks,\r\n  He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by\r\n      their parents.\r\n  The same at last and at last when peace is declared,\r\n  He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers\r\n      all pass through,\r\n  The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\r\n  The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,\r\n  He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands\r\n      and bids good-by to the army.\r\n       6\r\n  Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,\r\n  Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on\r\n      the old homestead.\r\n  A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,\r\n  On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\r\n  Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd\r\n      her face,\r\n  Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as\r\n      she spoke.\r\n  My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\r\n  She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and\r\n      pliant limbs,\r\n  The more she look'd upon her she loved her,\r\n  Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\r\n  She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook'd\r\n      food for her,\r\n  She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\r\n  The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the\r\n      afternoon she went away,\r\n  O my mother was loth to have her go away,\r\n  All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month,\r\n  She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,\r\n  But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.\r\n       7\r\n  A show of the summer softness--a contact of something unseen--an\r\n      amour of the light and air,\r\n  I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,\r\n  And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.\r\n  O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,\r\n  Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his thrift,\r\n  The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill'd.\r\n  Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,\r\n  The sailor sails, the exile returns home,\r\n  The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond months\r\n      and years,\r\n  The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with\r\n      the well known neighbors and faces,\r\n  They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off,\r\n  The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage\r\n      home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,\r\n  To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,\r\n  The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the\r\n      Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,\r\n  The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.\r\n  The homeward bound and the outward bound,\r\n  The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuye, the onanist, the female that\r\n      loves unrequited, the money-maker,\r\n  The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those\r\n      waiting to commence,\r\n  The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee\r\n      that is chosen and the nominee that has fail'd,\r\n  The great already known and the great any time after to-day,\r\n  The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,\r\n  The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced\r\n      him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,\r\n  The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,\r\n  The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,\r\n  The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,\r\n  I swear they are averaged now--one is no better than the other,\r\n  The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.\r\n  I swear they are all beautiful,\r\n  Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is\r\n      beautiful,\r\n  The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.\r\n  Peace is always beautiful,\r\n  The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.\r\n  The myth of heaven indicates the soul,\r\n  The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it\r\n      comes or it lags behind,\r\n  It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on itself\r\n      and encloses the world,\r\n  Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,and perfect and\r\n      clean the womb cohering,\r\n  The head well-grown proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and\r\n      joints proportion'd and plumb.\r\n  The soul is always beautiful,\r\n  The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,\r\n  What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place,\r\n  The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,\r\n  The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of\r\n      the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,\r\n  The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on\r\n      in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,\r\n  The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite--\r\n      they unite now.\r\n       8\r\n  The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,\r\n  They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as\r\n      they lie unclothed,\r\n  The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and American\r\n      are hand in hand,\r\n  Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand\r\n      in hand,\r\n  The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they\r\n      press close without lust, his lips press her neck,\r\n  The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with\r\n      measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with\r\n      measureless love,\r\n  The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,\r\n  The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is\r\n      inarm'd by friend,\r\n  The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar,\r\n      the wrong 'd made right,\r\n  The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master\r\n      salutes the slave,\r\n  The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane, the\r\n      suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,\r\n  The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is sound,\r\n      the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor distress'd\r\n      head is free,\r\n  The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother\r\n      than ever,\r\n  Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,\r\n  The swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in condition,\r\n  They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the\r\n      night, and awake.\r\n  I too pass from the night,\r\n  I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you.\r\n  Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?\r\n  I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,\r\n  I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,\r\n  I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but\r\n      I know I came well and shall go well.\r\n  I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,\r\n  I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.\r\n", "title": "The Sleepers"}

the future.\r\n  I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,\r\n  I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,\r\n  I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd.\r\n  The paths to the house I seek to make,\r\n  But leave to those to come the house itself.\r\n  Belief I sing, and preparation;\r\n  As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the present only,\r\n  But greater still from what is yet to come,\r\n  Out of that formula for thee I sing.\r\n       2\r\n  As a strong bird on pinions free,\r\n  Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,\r\n  Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,\r\n  Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.\r\n  The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,\r\n  Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,\r\n  Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or indoor\r\n      library;\r\n  But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or breath of\r\n      an Illinois prairie,\r\n  With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from Texas\r\n      uplands, or Florida's glades,\r\n  Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue

Seas of the world.\r\n  And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,\r\n  Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas fitted\r\n      for thee, real and sane and large as

thou\r\n      bear'st the other continents,\r\n  Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port triumphant;\r\n  Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman, thou\r\n      carriest great companions,\r\n  Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,\r\n  And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.\r\n       5\r\n  Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,\r\n
